# JavaScript Practice w/FreeCodeCamp 


Currently working through a variety of the JavaScript projects provided by FreeCodeCamp.

Those completed/in progess are in this directory, all others are in the 'projects-still-to-practice' directory.

Ran projects on my terminal with: `npx http-server . -c-1`
